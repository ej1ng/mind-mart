Jeremy keeps waking up with a feeling of unease that does not let up as the day goes on.
Throughout the day, he finds himself on edge and sometimes struggling to take deep breaths.
He constantly feels nervous, as if something bad may happen, and finds himself unable to concentrate at work as a result.
It takes him a long time to fall asleep at night due to the persistent feeling of dread that pervades his thoughts.
