Lori keeps getting scolded by her boss for what he sees as poor behaviour at work.
She often struggles to prioritize her tasks and is only able to work for short bursts before getting distracted.
She will sometimes begin new tasks even when she has not yet finished her current ones.
At work she feels restless, resulting in her often wandering off in thought when speaking to her colleagues.
