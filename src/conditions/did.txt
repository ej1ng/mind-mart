Robin feels overwhelmed as a result of his constant internal voices.
/He has talked to his friends about having out-of-body experiences /and seems to find himself operating at different levels of functioning, /with different handwriting and interests at different points in the /day.
His constant changes in train of thought have led to him feeling /a sense of loss of control in his life.
